        <!-- About Me Text -->
        <p>I am an Iranian academic with a strong background in law, specializing in energy law and justice. I have studied at some of the top universities in Iran, where admission is highly competitive. I earned my LLB from Shiraz University, one of the leading institutions for undergraduate studies in Iran. I then obtained my LLM in Oil and Gas Law from the University of Tehran, where I also completed my Ph.D. in the same field.</p>

        <p>During my Ph.D., I spent six months at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, for a research stay sponsored by the Swiss Mercator Foundation. After completing my Ph.D., I embarked on a three-year postdoctoral research project at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, sponsored by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and DAAD.</p>

        <p>My postdoctoral research marked a shift towards renewable and clean energy. Building on my previous work on upstream petroleum contracts, I developed a unique perspective on promoting clean energy through contractual transformation. Additionally, I framed my research within the paradigm of energy justice, recognizing its increasing importance. I devised a novel framework for energy justice centered on the concept of transactional justice.</p>

        <p>My research has opened two unique avenues in energy law:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The transformation of contractual aspects of clean energy, through comparative studies with upstream petroleum contracts.</li>
            <li>The development of transactional energy justice.</li>
        </ol>
